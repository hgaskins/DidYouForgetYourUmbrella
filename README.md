# DidYouForgetYourUmbrella
DidYouForgetYourUmbrella is an app that provides real time weather data from the openWeatherMap API. It uses CoreLocation for geolocation technologies as well as NSURL for networking the asynchronous calls to gather the data. 
RUN/BUILD Instructions: 

Open project file. 
Ensure that you have allowed for Core Location to be used within your Run Simulation. To edit this click the “Set Active Scheme” button in the top right of the Xcode panel > choose “Edit Scheme” from the drop down options there > from there go to the “Run” option on the left hand side panel > here choose “Options” at the top of the menu here > Once here, ensure the “Allow Location Simulation” option is checked and choose a default location (I chose Rio de Janeiro). Here is a quick video tutorial for additional reference:
